# MatrixGame
Pattern tracking game using a pointer laser. No photodetectors were used, only diode inversed biased algorithm was used to read the amount of light directly on the LEDs.

Please note that the could have been better with a lot more defines/functions/comments but it was made in a short period of time. I know it is not perfect, so when you scroll over it just note that. My main focus was to make it work as fast as possible.
